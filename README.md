The search for an effective malaria vaccine has been a long and often frustrating one. Only a single
vaccine, RTS,S, has reached Phase III trials, which are currently ongoing in >10,000 children across
Africa. While RTS,S may be licensed for use, it clearly has only partial efficacy with limited duration,
meaning that a second or third generation malaria vaccine will be required if a serious push for malaria
elimination is to be made. The malaria genome encodes more than 5,000 proteins, and identifying the
best candidates among them remains one of the central challenges of malaria vaccine development.
One approach is to understand how people develop immunity to malaria through natural exposure,
which can happen provided sufficient and repeated infections. Large numbers of immunoepidemiology
studies over the past decades have pursued this avenue, but all have had the same central problem –
they rely on recombinant Plasmodium antigens, so will only ever identify the candidates that have
already been selected for recombinant expression.

An alternative unbiased approach, which leverages nextgen sequencing technology, would be to
sequence the Ig repertoire of infected individuals to understand the breadth and depth of their
antibody responses. This approach has the advantage of being target agnostic - it will identify which
targets the immune system is responding to, without first selecting which targets to test. This project
pilots that approach for the first time in malaria infections by applying Ig repertoire sequencing
methods developed by other groups at the Sanger Institute. As a first target it will use RNA extracted
from B cells from malaria naïve individuals who have been experimentally challenged (infected) with
malaria in the context of vaccine trials, carried out by Simon Draper’s group at the Jenner Institute.
This rotation project has the potential to build into a PhD project using material from future vaccine
trials, as well as from experimental malaria challenge studies that will be carried out at the Wellcome
Trust Major Overseas Programme in Kilifi, Kenya. While listed as a wet-lab project because the initial
effort will be in library production, the project actually involves a mix of wet-lab molecular skills and
