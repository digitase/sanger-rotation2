# # Questions to ask
# 
# How is immunity to the vaccine candidate achieved? Due to antibodies... which we detect via:
# 
# - V-gene usage
# - clonotype abundance
# - mutational frequency
# 
# Things:
# 
# - V(D)J gene frequencies, Ig isotype usage, and BCR clone size, stratified by timepoint and patient
# - Look for expansion of clonotypes in day 63 and 140 vs. day 0
# - Compare expanded clonotypes to known Ab sequences
# - Look for differences between patients at day 0
# - Calculate mutational frequencies of clonotypes
# - Area/bar/parallel coords chart showing expansion of clonotypes (known V genes?) over time
# - 1 long stream plot showing abundances of clones over time in the 3 individuals
# 
# ## Comparison across individuals at pre-prime (day 0)
# 
# RH5 and Duffy samples
# 
# - Distribution of clonotypes between individuals
# - How diverse is the repertoire? Gini index?
# - Run comparison across cell types
# 
# ## Clonotypes at early post prime (day 28)
# 
# Look for:
# 
# - clonotype freq
# - isotype distribution
# - mutational freq (1-% identity) vs. IMGT V gene reference
#     - linear regression of BCR mutational frequency against clonotype V gene status
#     - mutational freq stratified by isotype
#     
# In the compartments:
# 
# - For memory cells vs day 0
# - For plasmablasts vs naive repertoire (IgD/IgM unmutated sequences taken from PBMC samples at Day 0)
# 
# - Are expanded/mutated clonotypes the same as the
#     - known anti-RH5 Ab sequences
#     - ones observed in AMA1 and Duffy trials
#     - ones observed in influenza and other infection challenge
# 
# ## Clonotypes at early post boost (day 63)
# 
# Look for:
# 
# - clonotype freq
# - isotype distribution
# - mutational freq (1-% identity) vs. IMGT V gene reference
#     - linear regression of BCR mutational frequency against clonotype V gene status
#     - mutational freq stratified by isotype
#     
# In the compartments:
# 
# - For memory cells vs day 0 and day 28
# - For plasmablasts vs plasmoblasts at day 0 and day 28
#     - activation of same clonotypes during prime and boost?
# - For plasmablasts vs naive repertoire at day 0 and day 28
# - For plasmablasts vs memory repertoire at day 0 and day 28
#     - recall of memory cells generated at the prime?
# 
# - clonotype overlap between 
# 
# ## Clonotypes at long term (day 140)
# 
# Look for:
# 
# - clonotype freq
# 
# In the compartments:
# 
# - For plasmablasts vs memory repertoire at day 63
#     - how much of the boost response is detectable in long term memory?
# 
# ## Identification of malaria specific mAbs
# 
# - Overlap with known anti RH5 mAbs (isolated from day 63), or clonotypes appearing in other infections/vaccinations in the literature
# - Can we expect cross-reactivity in clonotypes that would affect the inferences based on the BCR repertoire data?
